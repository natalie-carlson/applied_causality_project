I enjoyed both Gelman's papers and the discussion on Wednesday. Both were quite broad and non-technical, but I think what he provides is a useful framework for thinking about how to approach and frame causal questions, particularly for social scientists. Two elements were particularly useful for me: the distinction between forward and reverse causal questions, and the notion of the latter being a form of model checking. The recent faddishness of randomized program evaluations nonwithstanding, I think the most interesting questions in social science tend to be reverse causal questions, and they are interesting precisely \textit{because} our current mental model doesn't suffice to explain a particular phenomenon. The process of answering that question then becomes an iterative proess of rejecting that inadequate model, creating a new model in the form of a forward causal question, and then testing it.
