Having no baseline of genetics knowledge, I found this difficult to read and by nature very abstract. I tried to focus on the main contribution, which seemed to be captured in Figure 1 -- the idea that they could use the allele frequency to test for association between \textit{x} and \textit{y} via inverse regression. The allele frequency proxies for any latent variable \textit{z} which can be a confounder given the population structure (in my head I was imagining this referring to things like diet or climate). While this indeed seems useful, I was curious whether there are any potential extensions beyond the realm of genetics. If we think yes, I would love to see a more generalized representation of this model, because I got a bit bogged down in googling what SNPs and alleles are...
